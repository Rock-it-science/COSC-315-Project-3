## Design Choices:

* MyFileSystem:

    Takes diskName as input. The first  thing this function does is open the file with fileName to a global variable `file`. Segment Faultâ„¢

    ...

* Create:

* delete:

    Firstly, this function reads the suprblock into a buffer to be used in this function, storing the data in a char array called super.
    
    Next, it finds the inode with the name matching what it was handed as an argument.
    To keep track of the corresponding inode, it simply stores its index in the inodes array.
    
    Next, it will free the blocks that are to be deleted by setting their values to all 0. It does this by finding the indexes of the blocks' data and iterating through it, setting all of it to 0.
    
    The next step is to mark the inode as free. To do this, it has to find the free block list in the super block and mark the corresponding inode's `used` value to 0.
    
    Finally, the function writes the super block back to the file. It fseek to move the cursor back to the start of the file, and fputs to write the modified super block to that position. 

* ls: 
	Reads superblock for file names. Checks if they are empty to ensure blank lines are not printed. Due to issues with writing to the superblock, this function does not work as the data is stored in structs instead of directly on the superblock.

* read:
	Reads superblock to see if file with the input name and the appropriate block exists by checking the inode section. Due to issues with writing to the superblock, this function does not work as the data is stored in structs instead of directly on the superblock, meaning newly written files might be seen as non existent.

* write:
    

## Compile/run insturctions:
  1. Setup input instructions in lab3.input.txt
  
  1. cd into Part 2 directory (`cd 'Part 2'`)
        
        (ensure to do `cd ..` to get out of Part 1 directory)
  
  1. Compile files with make
        
        If make doesn't work compile with below commands:
        
          gcc -o create lab3.create_fs.c
        
          gcc -o fs FileSystem.c
  
  1. Run create with argument for disk name (`./create disk0`)
  
  1. Run fs (`./fs`)
